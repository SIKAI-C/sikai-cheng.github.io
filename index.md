## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), advised by [Prof. Pascal Van Hentenryck](https://sites.gatech.edu/pascal-van-hentenryck/). My research focuses on **machine learning and its integration with optimization**. I have made several successful attempts in applying these methods to large-scale transportation systems, wireless communications, and robust decision-making under uncertainty. In addition, I explore the reasoning capabilities of large language models and investigate reinforcement learning approaches for multi-agent systems.

Before beginning my Ph.D., I earned a Master’s degree in **Operations Research** from the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE)](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, and a Bachelor’s degree in **Data Science** from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en).

I have been fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Xin Chen](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/xin-chen) during my master’s studies, as well as [Dr. Xinyun Chen](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/63) and [Dr. Pengyi Shi](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~shi178/) during my undergraduate studies.

## Misc.

I’ve always loved sports 🤸. I practiced wrestling 🤼 and powerlifting 🏋️ with full passion, got hit with some major injuries 😅, fought my way back 💪, and—no surprise—I still can’t stay away from sports. These days I enjoy trying all kinds of activities — archery 🏹, bowling 🎳, paddleboarding 🏄, and regular gym training 💪. I’ve also wrestled (pun intended 😜) with attention and reading/writing challenges for years, collecting tons of practical tips (happy to share ✍️✨). Since GPT arrived, my writing block has basically vanished — thanks, GPT 🤖❤️.
